Getting Started
===============

This page details how to get started with MDonatello. 

Installation
------------

The ``mdonatello`` package is directly installable from the source.

First clone the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/talagayev/MDonatello

Then go into the ``MDonatello`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd MDonatello

Finally install of the necessary packages with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .


Usage
------------

To use the ``mdonatello`` package you need to run a jupyter notebook, thus run the command

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter notebook

Now that you started a jupyter notebook create a notebook file and enter the following command to use ``mdonatello``:

.. code-block:: text

    import MDAnalysis as mda
    import mdonatello
    from mdonatello import MoleculeVisualizer 

    u = mda.Universe("input.pdb")
    ag = u.select_atoms("resname UNK")
    visualizer = MoleculeVisualizer(ag, show_atom_indices=False, width=-1, height=-1)

Some Modifications may be required to obtain the visualization of your ligand:

1. Adjust the code to use your PDB File instead of **input.pdb**.

2. Select the ligand that you want to view by adjusting the name **resname UNK** to the resname of your ligand

Here is an example how the visualization should look like:

.. figure:: /_static/display_example.png
    :figwidth: 700px
    :align: center
